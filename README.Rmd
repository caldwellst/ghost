## Overview

ghost is an R package designed to provide a simple interface for extracting data from the World Health Organization's Global Health Observatory (GHO) database using the [Open Data Protocol API](https://www.who.int/data/gho/info/gho-odata-api). The package allows for exploration of indicators and dimensions available in the GHO and extract of these into R data frames.

* `gho_indicators()` provides a data frame of all available [indicators](https://www.who.int/data/gho/info/gho-odata-api#exe3) in the GHO.
* `gho_dimensions()` provides a data frame of all available [dimensions](https://www.who.int/data/gho/info/gho-odata-api#exe1) in the GHO.
* `gho_dimension_values()` provides a data frame of all available [values for a single dimension](https://www.who.int/data/gho/info/gho-odata-api#exe2) in the GHO.
* `gho_data()` extracts data from a selection of indicators in the GHO and outputs all results in a single data frame.

The interface is designed to be as simple as possible, only requiring input of the code of an indicator to extract it. However, it is also compatible with using more complex queries in line with the OData protocol. Details on its implementation available in the [OData documentation](https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/uri-conventions/).

ghost can be installed using `remotes::install_github("gpw13/ghost")`
